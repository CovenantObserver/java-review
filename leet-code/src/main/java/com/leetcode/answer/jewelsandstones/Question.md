You're given strings `J` representing the types of stones that are jewels, and `S` representing the stones you have.  Each character in `S`is a type of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

The letters in `J` are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in `J` and `S` are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so `"a"` is considered a different type of stone from `"A"`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: J = "z", S = "ZZ"
Output: 0
```

**Note:**

- `S` and `J` will consist of letters and have length at most 50.
- The characters in `J` are distinct.




### 翻译

在字符串J中有一串字符，S中也有一串字符，请统计S包含在J中的字符数量，重复的也算。
